## 📋 Email Distribution Strategy

### **For Split Contacts with Multiple Emails:**

**Angeline Liew & Miriam Lai (Tung Shin):**
- Contact both separately
- Different emails - can run simultaneous campaigns
- Coordinate if both respond positively

**Foo Ming Liang & Elisa Chew Lee Chen:**
- Each has own email
- Can approach independently
- Both from same organization - good for multi-threading

**Tang Ling Teng & Carmen (Bagan Specialist Centre):**
- Contact Tang first (listed first)
- Carmen as secondary contact
- Both have emails - good coverage

### **For Split Contacts with Shared Contact Info:**

**Emir & Azman (Fnb):**
- Shared phone only
- Contact once, ask for both
- Or choose one as primary

**Pham Thi Diem Phuong & Emily:**
- Email only for Pham
- Start with Pham
- Ask for Emily's contact during conversation
